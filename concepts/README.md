# Application Lifecycle

Once you have written your application code, the typical steps in the CI/CD pipeline include `building, packaging, testing, distributing, deploying, and monitoring`. Here's a detailed breakdown of each step along with popular tools for different programming languages:

###### Version Control:

- GitHub,
- GitLab,
- BitBucket

###### Build

Java:

- Tools: Maven, Gradle, Ant

- Process: Compile the source code into bytecode.

Python:

- Tools: setuptools, pybuilder, poetry

- Process: Check for dependencies and compile Python files to bytecode (if necessary).

Node.js:

- Tools: npm, yarn, webpack, Grunt
- Process: Install dependencies and compile/transpile the code (e.g., using Babel).


###### Testing

Java:

- Tools: JUnit, TestNG, Selenium

- Process: Run unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

Python:

- Tools: pytest, unittest, Selenium

- Process: Execute unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests.

Node.js:

- Tools: Mocha, Jasmine, Jest

- Process: Perform unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.



###### Packaging

Java:

- Tools: JAR, WAR, EAR packaging (using Maven or Gradle)

- Process: Package the compiled bytecode and dependencies into a deployable format.

Python:

- Tools: wheel, setuptools

- Process: Package the application and dependencies into a distributable format (e.g., wheel or tar.gz).

Node.js:

- Tools: npm, yarn
- Process: Bundle the application and its dependencies.


###### Distribution

Java:

- Tools: Nexus Repository, Artifactory, DockerHub
- Process: Store and distribute the packaged artifacts to a repository.

Python:

- Tools: PyPI, Artifactory, DockerHub
- Process: Upload the packaged artifacts to a repository.

Node.js:

- Tools: npm registry, Artifactory, DockerHub
- Process: Publish the package to a registry.

###### Deployment

Java:

- Tools: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Ansible, Kubernetes, AWS CodeDeploy

- Process: Deploy the packaged application to various environments (e.g., staging, production).

Python:

- Tools: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Ansible, Kubernetes, AWS CodeDeploy

- Process: Deploy the application to different environments.

Node.js:

- Tools: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Ansible, Kubernetes, AWS CodeDeploy

- Process: Deploy the application to various environments.


###### Monitoring

Common Tools:

- Prometheus: Monitoring and alerting toolkit.
- Grafana: Visualization and analytics tool.
- New Relic: Application performance monitoring.
- Datadog: Monitoring and security platform
